## Motivation of Project

Throughout the past decade, video consumption has steadily shifted from traditional cable to online streaming platforms. Services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO NOW are growing faster than anyone can expect. Even traditional tech companies like Amazon and Apple are trying to step into the tv industry by producing their own shows on their platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+. Predictions state that the global online video streaming market size will reach USD 184.3 billion by 2027[1], and the key to success and gaining more subscriptions is to produce and stream popular TV shows. There is an increasing amount of interest in predicting a show’s popularity on social media, but not a lot of research has been conducted using machine learning. Therefore, we deem it worthwhile to see how machine learning techniques, such as clustering[2] and density estimation, can lead to better prediction of popular titles, which can be applied to better recommendation techniques.
